# Surround 360 Rendering Software

Surround 360 is a hardware and software system for capturing and rendering 3d (stereo) 360 videos and photos, suitable for viewing in VR. This subdirectory of the project is specific to rendering software.

## Requirements

* The Surround 360 rendering software requires either Linux or Mac OS X

* The essential dependencies of the Surround 360 rendering software are:
  * CMake
  * gflags
  * glog
  * OpenCV 3.0+

* Additional optional functionality depends on:
  * ffmpeg
  * Gooey
  * wx

## Installing Dependencies of the Surround 360 Rendering Software

* After building all of the dependencies and the rendering code itself, there are no further installation steps.

* The build system for the Surround 360 code is CMake.

* This software has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 LTS (CMake 3.2.2) and OS X 10.11.5 (using CMake 3.5.1).

* If you are building on OS X, it may be more convenient to use brew to install some dependencies.

* (to use accelerated ISP) Install Halide
```
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/halide/Halide.git
```
  see README file inside Halide directory for installation instructions, including LLVM dependency. Follow steps in use "Building Halide with cmake". If the make step throws errors about unused variables, add the option ```-DWARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF``` to the cmake command

## Compiling the Surround 360 Rendering Software

* After installing all of the dependencies as described above, run:
```
  cd <install_path>/surround360/surround360_render
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make
```

  (to use accelerated ISP):
```
  cd <install_path>/surround360/surround360_render
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHALIDE_DIR=$HOME/Halide/cmake_build
  make
```

* To test that compilation is successful, run:
```
  ./bin/TestRenderStereoPanorama --help
```

* Follow the steps in CALIBRATION.md and RENDER.md to know how to get the best results when using the Surround360 software

* We recommend configuring CMake to compile in Release mode because the code will execute faster. However, you can also set it up for debug mode with:
```
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

* Sometimes it is useful to compile with XCode instead of CMake (e.g., to use its profiling and debugging tools). To do so:
```
  cd <install_path>/surround360/surround360_render
  mkdir XCodeDebug
  cd XCodeDebug
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Xcode ..
```
